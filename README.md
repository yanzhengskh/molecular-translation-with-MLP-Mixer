# molecular-translation-with-MLP-Mixer
This repository is the solution of https://www.kaggle.com/c/bms-molecular-translation. I use Xception as encoder, then do depth-wise and width-wise connection alternatively as decoder, something like MLP-Mixer(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.01601.pdf), but not exactly the same. I implement with pytorch cnn
